# NLP pipelines with SOTA solutions

Here you can find some light pipelines with quick solutions for **NER/Topic modelling/Text Classification** with using NLP SOTA techniques.<br />
Main focus on ready-made solutions like pre-trained **_[BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805)/ [roBERTa](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692)/ [XLnet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08237)_** transformers and brief "how-to-use" setup with applications.
